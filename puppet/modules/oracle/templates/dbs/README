The files in this directory should be seen as a series of sample scripts.
The script containing a 'create database' is automatically supplied
by the Oracle easy_type and does not need to be provided the type also
provides the minimal database catalog consisting of 'catalog.sql' and 'catproc.sql'.
When opting for a RAC based database, the 'catclust.sql' is also loaded and does not
need to be specified by the other (optional) supplied configuration scripts.

Any user specified script can be used as part of the confile_script list of files.

Required '.erb' variables by these sample scripts are :
  @oracle_base	-> f.e. '/opt/oracle'
  @db_name	-> f.e. 'PROD01'
  @db_password	-> f.e. 'Need_New_Password'

Note: due to the nature the output is analyzed, either nothing or
a comma separated string should be returned.
